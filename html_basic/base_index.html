    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <h3>Getting Started with HTML</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>This is my very first webpage created as part of my portfolio project. It contains headings, paragraphs, and even a clickable image!</p>

    <p>HTML is the basic building block of the web. By learning it, I am beginning my journey into web development.</p>

    <p>In this page, I am practicing how to use different tags, including headings, paragraphs, and images that link to other pages on the internet.</p>

    <p>With this knowledge, I will be able to build more advanced projects in the future, such as styled pages, interactive applications, and full websites.</p>
